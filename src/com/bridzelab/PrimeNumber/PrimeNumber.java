/* Q-3.) Prime Number
		Just like the Perfect number, the Prime number is also a special type of number. When
		the number is divided greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself is referred to as the Prime
		number. 0 and 1 are not counted as prime numbers. All the even numbers can be
		divided by 2, so 2 is the only even prime numbers.
